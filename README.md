# Voygo : AI Powered Travel Companion

Voygo is an AI-powered travel companion designed to assist users in planning personalized travel itineraries. The system generates detailed, day-wise travel plans based on user inputs such as destination, trip duration, budget, and interests.

The application follows a hybrid methodology that combines structured planning logic with generative AI models. Cloud-based services on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are used to manage backend infrastructure, authentication, and data storage, while Google APIs are leveraged to support AI-driven generation and contextual travel information. The architecture is modular and cloud-native, enabling scalable deployment and clear separation between the user interface, itinerary generation logic, and supporting services.

Voygo also provides itinerary-aware booking redirection by generating dynamic links to trusted third-party travel platforms, allowing users to move seamlessly from planning to booking without handling transactions directly. The project is developed as an academic prototype, with an emphasis on clarity, extensibility, and real-world applicability.
